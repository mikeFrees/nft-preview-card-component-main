## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- pseudo elements & classses
- SCSS
- fontsource
- NPM
- normalize.css

### What I learned

i learned how to write the package.json for NPM and how to initialize my project. Also i started to understand how to use the pseudo classes and elements. i had some trouble with the placement of an svg element and how to create a good transparent color overlay on hover put i managed to finally figure it out.

I tried to use bootstrap at the start of this project but my HTML file felt too cluttered with al these divs added to it, so i took a step back and continued with HTML and SCSS for the moment.

### Continued development

I will try to read up on how to use bootsrap and try to get a better understanding of it and i would like to document my code better and write my Read me file while i develop a project so that i can recal where i got my ideas from and which rescources i used.
